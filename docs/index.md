> UMD is a new type of document that can hold one or more content types that can be shared, viewed and edited. The media content can be: **text**, **images**, **video**, **audio**, **pdf** and **forms**.

### Features
* It is a **container** document (*like zip*) that holds the different elements.
* The individual elements can be either **links** or be **included** in the document.
* Like any other document it can be *transported* via email or stored in a network drive or posted in a messenging platform like any other document.
* A free Viewer/ Creation tool is available to generate and / or view an UMD file.
* It is an open-source project with the specs available for contribution / enhancement.
* A UMD Viewer webcomponent is available to embed it in websites or webapps.

### Use Cases
In today's visual world, we mostly express ourselves using different multimedia. 

**Education**: The lack of easily using multiple media in a single document is most experienced in training and education content. The following can very easily be included in a UMD document. 
* An image with an accompanying audio.
* A video link with an accompaning text summary.
* A PDF document with an accompany assessment.
* Some text followed by an image with a video link and a concluding PDF.
<br/>
**Brochures**: Grabbing the attention of your target groups is always a challenge. UMDs would be the perfect format for marketing collateral that has a combination of videos + text + pdf content.
<br/>
**Ideation**: If you wish to put together your thoughts with accompanying multimedia including images + audio + video, and wish to share it privately, UMD is the ideal candidate.
