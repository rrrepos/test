### Examples
This section will showcase some examples of the use of umd as well as different ways in which they can be shared.

#### 1. **Loading of local umd file in the app**:
This educational example uses a combination of Image + Markdown text + Youtube Video + Google Form as its content.

1. For demo purposes, download [sample-edu.umd]("./files/sample-edu.umd") to your local device (desktop / mobile).
2. Open the [UMD App](https://umd-project.org/app){:target="_blank"}
3. From the app screen, load the downloaded umd file in the app.

#### 2. **Loading of a password-protected umd file.**:
The content is the same as Example 1 except that the UMD file is password protected.

1. Download [sample-edu-pw.umd]("./files/sample-edu-pw.umd") to your local device (desktop / mobile).
2. Open the [UMD App](https://umd-project.org/app){:target="_blank"}
3. From the app screen, load the downloaded umd file in the app. It will prompt you for a password. The password is: **umd is wow**.

#### 3. **Loading of a umd file from an internet server**:
In this example, we will demo how to load a file that has previously been uploaded to an internet server.

1. Open the [UMD App](https://umd-project.org/app){:target="_blank"}
2. In the space provided to enter the url, type the link given below: 
3. `https://storage.googleapis.com/dap-demo-cors/sample-edu.umd`. 

#### 4. **Sharing a link to directly open a UMD File.**
This demonstrates how you can send a link to another person to directly open the UMD by just clicking on it. This is a variation of Example 3 where the user is not required to type the link.

1. If the following link is shared with you, just click on it to open the umd file.
2. [https://umd-project.org/app?url=https://storage.googleapis.com/dap-demo-cors/sample-edu.umd](../app?url=https://storage.googleapis.com/dap-demo-cors/sample-edu.umd){:target="_blank}
