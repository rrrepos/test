This section will provide more details of the UMD project.

### About UMD
#### What is UMD
UMD is a new type of document. It stands for **Universal Markup Document**. The spec uses vanilla markup language to specify its content. It supports multiple content types within one document; hence it is a Universal document.

#### What is the need for a new type of document
In today's visual world most users would like to use a combination of content when communicating with others. Just a video is not enough. Similar though the PDF is a convenient and popular format it has its own limitations. Many users who have the need to use  combination of media types (image, text, audio, video, pdf) need some sort of a website to put that content up. A blogging website is a classic example. UMD now gives you the power to create such a document on your own to share it with who you wish without a website.
